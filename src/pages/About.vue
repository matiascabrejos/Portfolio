      <h1 class="text-title">Hi there! Let me introduce myself</h1>
      <div class="text-description">
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I'm MatÃ­as Cabrejos, a Front-End Developer who is passionate about
          programming and especially of VueJS.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I'm always curious about new skills, tools, and concepts. This gets me
          to being constantly learning about new technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I strongly believe that being a good developer is more than just
          knowing how to write code. So I've learned about soft skills like
          Communication, Flexibility, TeamWork and Self-Confidence in order to
          become a well rounded developer.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I've learned english since I was a kid. I can speak and write english
          fluently.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Besides coding, I enjoy playing football and running. I'm also really
          interested into the crypto world and economics.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I'm looking forward to new challenges. I'm open minded about learning
          a new tech stack if needed.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          I'm currently available for freelance projects or full-time work. If
